# 💸 YalaPay Project Repository

The **YalaPay App** is being developed in two phases with the goal of managing invoice payments and streamlining business-to-customer financial interactions. YalaPay accelerates customer payment collection, supports cheque cashing, and provides useful financial reports to monitor outstanding payments.

## 📅 Project Phases

- **Phase 1:** Focuses on UI design and implementation, including functionalities to manage invoices, payments, and cheques using local JSON files for data interaction.
- **Phase 2:** Expands on Phase 1 by integrating a local database and implementing data persistence with Cloud Firestore.
